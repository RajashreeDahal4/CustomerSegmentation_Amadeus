# CustomerSegmentation_Amadeus
This project is done during **Amadeus Session**
The objective of market segmentation is to divide a broad target market of customers into smaller, more similar groups and then design a marketing strategy specifically for each group. Clustering is a common technique to automatically find similar groups within a given data set. In this analysis, we will use clustering to find similar groups of customers within an airline's frequent flyer program, so that the airlines can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers.
