# CustomerSegmentation_Amadeus
This project is done during **Amadeus Session**

The objective of market segmentation is to divide a broad target market of customers into smaller, more similar groups and then design a marketing strategy specifically for each group. Clustering is a common technique to automatically find similar groups within a given data set. In this analysis, we will use clustering to find similar groups of customers within an airline's frequent flyer program, so that the airlines can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers.


## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as FlyerData.cs. It comes from the textbook **"Data Mining for Business Intelligence," by Galit Shmueli, Nitin R. Patel, and Peter C. Bruce**.

## Install

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:

   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn

## Summary

This python code shows a descriptive way of how to cluster customer data using unsupervised machine learning tools to dentify groups, or segments, of the airlines customer base in order to drive more sales. To best follow through the report, it is helpful to install [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you'd like to only view the report, feel free to check out the customer_segmentation_Airlines.html file.

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory creating_customer_segmentation_Airlines/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
```
ipython notebook customer_segmentation_Airlines.ipynb 
```
```
jupyter notebook customer_segmentation_Airlines.ipynb
```
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
